## 1. Arbitrage opportunities

What is an arbitrage opportunities?
When the **highest seller** and **lowest bidder** has a price difference and when a third person comes in **buy** it from the seller and sells it to bidder and the **profit** that particular person makes in this traction.

suppose David is selling a stock at Rs.10 and Rahul makes an offer of Rs.12 and Ankur comes in buys it from David and sells it to Rahul. The 2 Rupees profit he makes during the transcition is an Arbitrage opportunity.

Our Task is to find this particular situation, using the data we have been provided and see how much profit one can make.

The code of this nothing more than the if-else statement.

## 2. Stock Analysis and technical analysis.

In this part of this project we will use charts such as **candlestick pattern** to make the analysis of the project!
**(To be given a detailed update, when this part starts)**

## 3. Improve the prediction using sector analysis

Our model will make a analysis based on whats going on the whole sector, Like whats generally going on the whole IT industries. 
Even using NIFTY and SENSEX data

## 4. Fundamental analysis using the data over the internet

Most of the times the stock prices depends upon what's going on the news and economy of the country or the infilation of the country. Probaly there are many external factors.
